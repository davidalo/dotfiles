This command is plan-only. Do not implement.
If you are Claude, enter plan mode and use your internal plan mode. If you are Codex, GPT, or another model, follow `skills/planning-standards/SKILL.md` for the planning workflow.
When implementation starts, follow `skills/coding-standards/SKILL.md` and `skills/testing-standards/SKILL.md`.
