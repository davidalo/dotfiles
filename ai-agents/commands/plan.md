This command is plan-only. Do not implement.
When implementation starts, follow `skills/coding-standards/SKILL.md` and `skills/testing-standards/SKILL.md`.

# Workflow

## High-level steps

1. Read the related code, `README.md`, and any relevant documentation it references.
2. Identify ambiguities and ask clarifying questions before planning.
3. Draft a detailed, step-by-step blueprint for building the feature.
4. Break that plan into small, iterative chunks.
5. Refine until each step is small enough to implement safely with thorough tests, yet large enough to move the project forward.
6. Present the plan for approval and wait before implementing.
