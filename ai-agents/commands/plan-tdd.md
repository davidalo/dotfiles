This command is plan-only. Do not implement.
When implementation starts, follow `skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`, `skills/testing-standards/SKILL.md`, and `skills/coding-standards/SKILL.md`.

# Workflow

## High-level steps

1. Start from `master` or `main` (unless told to work on a different branch).
2. Plan only. Do not modify anything.
3. Present the plan and code architecture in the terminal; do not create extra files.
   - The code architecture must be presented as a block diagram with the different entities.
   - Lay out the implementation plan as numbered Step X sections, each with indented sub-bullets for the details.
   - Lay out a change list with the changes per file or feature.
4. Once approved, implement following the TDD skill.

## Plan mode

* Read the related code, `README.md`, and any relevant documentation it references.
* If the contribution is big and it contains changes in many codebase features, draft the proposed code architecture and how new code fits the existing codebase.
* Draft a detailed, step-by-step blueprint for building the feature.
* Break that plan into small, iterative chunks.
* Refine until each step is small enough to implement safely with thorough tests, yet large enough to move the project forward.
* Ask any question you need about architecture or implementation details.
* Do not start implementing until the plan is approved.
